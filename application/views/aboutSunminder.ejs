        <p> 
        My name is Sunminder Sandhu, iâ€™m currently a senior at San Francisco State University, majoring in Computer Science. Outside of school, I love watching movies, traveling and reading books. I interned as a programmer analyst intern at E&J Gallo winery over the summer, where I got first hand experience on the how the IT field works. After I graduate I would love to work as programmer in the IT field.
